# CPE 1040 - Introduction to Compueter Engineering #
## Assignment - Final Project ##
## Part 1 (Week 12, Assignment #7) ##
### Week 12 - Micro:bit I/O ###
## LED's: ##
## Part 1: Original Guide ##
This program is the base foundation to show we know how to set up an external device using the micro:bit. The program does a cycle rotation for the LED's connected and lights up each LED one at a time.

## Part 2: Enable Matrix ##
This program utilizes the knowledge we have from part one but modifies it so that we are able to use the led matrix and the micro:bit aswell.

## Part 3: Twenty-Eight ##
This program extends the previous screensaver assignment by incorporating the external LED's to make a new screensaver.

## Part 4: Digital input ##
This program uses the workstation to emit a signal that lights up the external LED on the micro:bit when a '1' is detected.

## Part 5: Manual Calibration (Soil Sensor) ##
This program takes a reading of moisture levels after the user inputs the range levels for the soil sensor to read.

## Part 6: Auto Calibration (Soil Sensor) ##
This program prompts the user to take three initial dry and wet readings using arrows displayed on the LED matrix of the micro:bit. It alternates from dry reading to wet readings. After the user records the six readings, the program ranges the values of dry and wet to set a base dry and wet reading that the micro:bit can evaluate on. If done correctly "calibration success" displays on the micro:bit. The micro:bit LED matrix lights up on how wet a reading is.
